## About the Project

AD Tools is a collection of tools to help Application Designers doing their jobs.

## Platform

AD Tools is designed to be a Web Application and Desktop Application (Developed using Tauri for macOS only).

## Development

- When developing the Web Application, we use Vanilla Javascript with Vite. Testing should be using `npm run dev` to start the development server. Check for the existing running server (port 5173, 5174, 5175) before running this command.
- When developing the Desktop Application, we use Tauri with Rust. Testing should be using `npx tauri dev` to start the development server. Check for the existing running server before running this command.
